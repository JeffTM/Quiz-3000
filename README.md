# Quiz-3000
A quiz program that was part of my winter 2017 honors project.
This project is interesting because I wrote a very basic XML style interpreter for saving files.

## To run:
Open the solution file in Visual Studio 2017 or later.
It should run under a standard C++ setup in VS 2017.
No dependencies
